        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hello, I am Shane Noble, an aspiring web developer.</p>
        <p>I'm originally from Sullivan, IN, a small town about 3 hours from Louisville.  I was recruited to play baseball at Bellarmine University, signed on, and I've been in Louisville ever since.</p>
        <p>While taking on a Master's in teaching at Bellarmine, I worked at the Louisville Marriott Downtown in the front office.  I developed great customer service skills while in the hospitality industry.  I held onto the job part-time for extra income for nearly 8 years!  I still value the experience, but I knew it was never the career for me.</p>
        <p>Once I finished my teaching degree, I landed a position at Zoneton Middle School in Bullitt County.  I taught Language Arts and a few years of 8th grade Social Studies.  That was great because it was American history from Columbus up to Reconstruction after the Civil War, with the Constitution and Bill of Rights in between.  I also taught a seminar class where I chose the topic: Psychology/Sociology.  Kids loved it!  I'm sure a few will pursue careers in those fields someday.</p>
        <p>I loved teaching, but I was drawn to trying different things.  I have a diverse range of interests.  In my first job post-teaching, I figured out that auditing healthcare claims...probably didn't fall into that range of interests (does anyone grow up wanting to be a claims auditor?).  I needed to develop a few new skills to find a desirable occupation.</p>  
        <p>Fast forward to today, I've completed the "Code Lou" @Bellarmine program and I am excited to find work in this growing field.  I am a creative person, and this is the perfect outlet.  I've immersed myself in coding and web develop for at least a few hours every single day.  The foundation is there -- I want to take it to the next level.</p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>Get a job!</p>
        <p>After that, I really want to focus on learning Javascript.  I found it to be the most challenging and intriguing part of my recent learning.  I've practiced with vanilla Javascript, jQuery, and React framework.  I am nowhere near competent just yet -- but it's my #1 goal (...after getting a job)!</p>
        <p>I also want to learn some C++.  Growing up, I played a MUD, or a "Multi-User Dungeon" text-based game, a relic from the earliest days of online-gaming.  The "room" you were in had a paragraph description, you walked north, south, etc., and typed commands like 'kill dragon' or to cast a spell.  Despite having no graphics, it was the best game I ever played!  It was built with a C++ codebase, and at least on a hobbyist level, I'd like to be able to understand it, or even contribute to it.</p>
